Apart from the <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/">public hub</a>, Kubera Chaos gives you the ability to create a private customized  hub wherein you can remove and add experiments in a workflow.<br><br>
<p style="color:white;font-size:20px;">Connecting a new chaos hub :</p>
To connect a new chaos hub, go to “My Hub” and click on “Connect a new chaos hub”.

Provide a name for the hub. 
Next, enter the URL and branch name of the github repository that contains the experiment(s) that have to be added.

Click on “Submit Now”, Kubera Chaos Portal will now be able to fetch the experiments under the Hub from the linked github repository and display them on the “My Hubs” page.
