* Kubera Enterprise is software that helps with the use of Kubernetes as a data plane. Kubera includes optional 24x7 support from MayaData as well as underlying open source projects. In addition, Kubera includes advanced access controls, team based collaboration, visual configuration and management, and assistance in troubleshooting and common tasks such as upgrading and uninstalling Kubera itself.

* Kubera Propel is a module of Kubera Enterprise. Kubera Propel is based upon the CNCF project OpenEBS. OpenEBS Mayastor is open source Container Attached Storage - a pattern that includes the use of Kubernetes itself as a control plane for storage in order to deliver per workload storage. Teams and workloads that have different needs can use OpenEBS in different ways - and can remain loosely coupled; this is extremelydifferent from traditional shared everything storage. Kubera Propel is perhaps best known due to multiple benchmarks in the Fall of 2020 indicating that it is extremely performant and appears to be the lowest latency widely deployed storage software available for Kubernetes.

* Kubera Chaos is a module of Kubera Enterprise. Kubera Chaos is based upon the CNCF project Litmus Chaos. Litmus is a widely used Chaos Engineering project, consisting of an easy to extend framework for chaos engineering and a chaos hub, containing popular chaos experiments. Litmus and Kubera Chaos are often used both in CI/CD pipelines and in production environments to improve the resilience of Kubernetes environments including workloads running on Kubernetes and Kubernetes deployments themselves. 
<br><br>
* Subscription management of Kubera Enterprise is performed via a portal hosted on MayaData.io called Kubera Portal. Instructions on the use of Kubera Portal are also available below.
