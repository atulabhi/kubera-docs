Kubera Chaos portal supports running chaos on remote kubernetes agents(clusters). There are two ways of connecting a kubernetes agents with the Kubera Chaos portal.

- Local cluster (Internal)
- Gitops cluster (External)
<br>
<p style="color:white;font-size:16px;">Local Clusters:</p>
Self cluster is the cluster where portal’s components are running. Self cluster connection can be tuned by an environment variable called “self-cluster”: Boolean, present in the k8s-manifest. Based on that environment variable, the cluster is connected after the creation of the first project by Admin.
<br>
<p style="color:white;font-size:16px;">Gitops Clusters:</p>
External cluster is the remote cluster where users can orchestrate chaos from the chaos portal. A Cluster can be connected by applying a Kubernetes manifest generated by the portal. 

<i>
Note: 

- Any kind of kubernetes cluster can be connected with the Kubera Chaos portal.
- Manifest’s endpoint gets expired after being applied once by the user.
- You can find the manifest’s endpoint on the Agents page under Agent details.
